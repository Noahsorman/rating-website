            <h1>Frudrunq</h1> 
            <p>A.K.A - <i>Lurig</i></p>
            <br><h3>Has been in Skrallgaming's Smash community since the <i>SS3B</i> times. 
                Frudrunq started out maining <i>Ganondorf</i> since it was a very popular character back then, 
                with many other players enjoying him but also <a href="JukDk.html">JukDk</a> maining him. 
                Frudrunqs playstyle differed from the one of JukDk's, where he'd use more aireals instead of special abilities.
                At SSE-MI 2016 he lost to his rival JukDk 1-2 and finished the tournament 7th. 
                The year after at SSE-LI he finished last with his teammate <a href="Barre.html">Barre</a>.
                At SSE-II 2017 Frudrunq together with <a href="Izizaki.html">Izizaki</a> went to winners finals,
                eventually finishing 3rd, his best placement so far. 
                2018 at SSE-II he'd team up with low ranked <a href="YMG.html">YMG</a> and face off his rival JukDk once again, 
                teamed up with Frudrunqs former teamate and the (at the time) #4 player Barre..
                Though, there was no stopping Frudrunq sending JukDk and Barre to the losers bracket and finally finishing 4th.    
                <br><i>Will he be the best Ganondorf main once again?</i>
                <br><br>Placings: 
                <ul>
                    <li>4th at SSE-II | 2018 (Doubles)</li>
                    <li>3rd at SSE-II | 2017 (Doubles)</li>
