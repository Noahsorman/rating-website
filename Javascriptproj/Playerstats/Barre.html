            <h1>Barre</h1> 
            <p>A.K.A - <i>Nugget</i></p>
            <br><h3>Joined SG in late <i>SS3B</i> times. He came as an underdog, never touched the game but quickly rose to become one of the best, currently ranked #4.
                Barre started out as a very defensive player who excelled in projectiles and spacing with characters such as <i>Link</i> and <i>Lucario</i>. 
                Despite <i>Lucario</i> seeming to be a perfect fit for Barre, the character was also his downfall as Barre couldn't control his recovery very well. 
                At SSE-MI 2016 he was very close of beating a god (<a href="LTR.html">LTR</a>) 1v1 ending the set 2-3, placing 3rd. 
                SSE-LI 2017  was a down-time for Barre where he finished last, and also 5th in the unranked melee tournament.
                So, 2017 being his <i>Link</i> year, he as some others, swapped to main <i>Cloud</i> for 2018. 
                After the first SSE-II event (2017) he seemed to be rising towards his previously expected potential finishing 4th. 
                Sadly, the year after, he finished last once again. This leaves Barre very fluid and unpredictable.. 
                His 1v1 skills are easily considered one of the best, but he may depend too much on his team combination during tournaments.
                <br><i>Where do barre stand? At rank 3? or maybe 7? </i>  
                <br><br>Placings: 
                <ul>
                    <li>7th at SSE-II | 2018 (Doubles)</li>
                    <li>4th at SSE-II | 2017 (Doubles)</li>
                    <li>5th at SSE-LI | 2017 (Doubles Melee)</li>
                    <li>7th at SSE-LI | 2017 (Doubles)</li>
