            <h1>KP57</h1> 
            <p>A.K.A - <i>Kalle P</i></p>
            <br><h3>Played his first and so far only event, 2017 at SSE-LI. 
                He came as a true underdog that noone feared, since he only played FPS games.
                However, together with <a href="LTR.html">LTR</a> 
                they placed 1st aswell as 2nd in the unranked tournament! 
                He picked up Kirby and instantly discovered the Down-B tactic which was already known for some old-timers,
                but devastating for newer players to adapt to. It is hence today refered to as the 'Kalle P-tactic'.<br>
                One tournament, one 1st placing and a tactic named after him, KP57 has earned his rank #7.
                Some say LTR carried him, but Kp57 himself said the tournament was an easy win and that the game is trash.
                <br><i>Will he stomp the haters?</i>  
                <br><br>Placings: 
                <ul>
                    <li>2nd at SSE-LI | 2017 (Doubles Melee)</li>
                    <li>1st at SSE-LI | 2017 (Doubles)</li>
